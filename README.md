# React Native Tic Tac Toe

### Description
A 1-day (24-hour) build: simple tic tac toe game. The app keeps track of how many games each player won, but scorekeeping is temporary - when the app is closed, scores are reset to 0. Players can reset each game and reset scores using in-game controls.

### Installation
To run the app, pull the repository and run `npm install` script. After it finishes, run `npm run start` - this script will start an expo dev server for you. You can connect to it, if you have mobile app [Expo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent). For info on creating production build, refer to [Expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/introduction/).
